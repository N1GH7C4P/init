# The file resolv.conf typically contains search directives that specify the default search domains used for completing a given query name to a fully qualified domain name when no domain suffix is supplied. 
# For instance, search example.com local.test configures the resolver to try additionally somehost.example.com and somehost.local.test.
# it also contains a list of IP addresses of nameservers for resolution. 
# For instance, nameserver 1.1.1.1 configures the resolver to query for the name server with IP 1.1.1.1.
# Additional nameserver directives after the first are only used when the first or last used server is unavailable.
